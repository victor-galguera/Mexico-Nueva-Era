# Block Shortcode

Easily embed Drupal blocks in nodes, other blocks, or anywhere text formats are allowed using the [Shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode "Shortcode documentation on wordpress.org") syntax common in Wordpress.

## Why?

We've often come across situtations where we need to place a block on a page somewhere that Drupal's 
regions wouldn't allow (e.g., within paragraphs of text in a Node). The shortcode syntax provides a 
straightforward, secure way to do this.

## How?

1. Enable the module.
2. Add the Block Shortcode filter to any desired text format.
3. Now anytime you want to embed a block, copy the shortcode example from the Block's configuration 
page and paste into the place you want the block to appear.
